Abstract of the work:

Targeting intracellular pathways with peptide drugs is becoming increasingly desirable but often limited in application due to their poor cell permeability. Understanding cellular permeability of peptides remains a major challenge with very little structure-activity relationship known. Fortunately, there exist a class of peptides called Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPPs), which have the ability to cross cell membranes and are also capable of delivering biologically active cargo into cells. Discovering patterns that make peptides cell-permeable have a variety of applications in drug delivery. 
In the current study, we build prediction models for CPPs exploring features covering a range of properties based on amino acid sequences, using Random forest classifiers which are often more interpretable than other ensemble machine learning algorithms. While obtaining prediction accuracies of ~96%, we also interpret our prediction models using TreeInterpreter, LIME and SHAP to decipher the contributions of important features and optimal feature space for CPP class. 
We propose that our work might offer an intuitive guide for incorporating features that impart cell-penetrability into the design of novel CPPs.
